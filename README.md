h1. Exploring Static Types

â€‹For twenty years JavaScript's dynamic typing has given us an easy-to-use scripting language. But now Flow and TypeScript are changing the foundations of the language. Far from turning our code into an object oriented mess, static typing gives us JavaScript code that's cleaner, simpler and more predictable.

Type safety removes boilerplate assertions, needless unit tests, and the need to create class-based APIs. And by embracing the nature of typechecking, we end up with interfaces that are easier for humans to understand too.
